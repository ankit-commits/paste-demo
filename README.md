# Trying out PASTE with a VM

This repository contains a Vagrantfile that sets up a VM with PASTE and an example app, and serves requests generated by the host over TCP.
PASTE (stands for Packet Store)
* Enables NIC DMA to Non-Volatile Main Memory (NVMM)
* Helps apps organize persistent data structures (e.g., WAL, B+tree) on NVMM
* Lets apps use the kernel TCP/IP and be protected
* Is a high-performance network stack even without NVMM, making your apps ready to support it.

Michio Honda, Giuseppe Lettieri, Lars Eggert and Douglas Santry, "PASTE: A Network Programming Interface for Non-Volatile Main Memory", USENIX NSDI 2018 (https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi18/presentation/honda) 

Code: https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap/tree/paste

## The VM contains:
* Linux kernel 4.11 compiled with necessary configuration (deployed/net-next/.config)
* PASTE implementation (deployed/netmap) and a test app (deployed/tinyhttpd)
* Reserved DRAM region for NVMM emulation (/dev/pmem0)

## Prerequisite
* Install Virtualbox, Vagrant in your Mac or Linux
* Install wrk in your Mac (brew install wrk) or Linux (apt-get install wrk)
* Note that the VM will launch with 2GB of memory (including emulated NVMM)

## How to launch the VM
Note: I use prompt `host%` for commands to be executed at the host, and `vm%` for those to be executed at the VM

`host% git clone git@github.com:micchie/paste-demo.git`

`host% cd paste-demo`

`host% vagrant up`

## How to run PASTE in the VM

SSH to the VM (or just go to the VM console)

`host% vagrant ssh`

Setup emulated NVMM, NICs etc.

`vm% sudo bash -x ./setup.sh`

Confirm your host can talk to this VM with the experiment NIC

`host% ping 192.168.18.18`

  Edit Vagrantfile and setup.sh in the VM (and "vagrant reload") if you want to change this VM's address

Run PASTE server app in this VM

`vm% sudo ./deployed/tinyhttpd/tinyhttpd -i eth1 -d /mnt/pmem/dumb -m -x 768`

After starting to see output from nm_main_thread at the VM, Run wrk in your host

`host% wrk -d 2 -c 10 -t 10 http://192.168.18.18:60000/ -s post1280.lua`	

In this setup the server in the VM runs PASTE with packet buffers backed by
NVMM.
The client at the host continually generates 1280B HTTP POSTs over 10 TCP
connections and threads.

To run the server without NVMM-backed packet buffers (i.e., just as a high
performance network stack), change `-x` to `-L`, which will copy data from
normal packet buffers to an emulated NVMM region.
To run it with vanilla socket API (i.e., without PASTE), change `-x` to `-L` and
remove `-i eth1`.  To run it with busy polling, add `-b 0` (no matter with and
without PASTE).

## If you are interested in more...
Please read the NSDI paper, and take a look at tinyhttpd.c at
deployed/tinyhttpd to learn how to write app.  
I will keep adding more useful information here too!
